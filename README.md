# Bachelorproject
This is the software project of my bachelor's thesis.
This project is about comparing different operator and
parameter combinations of genetic algorithms to solve a RCPSP.

# Description of the System
The software system consists of several files.

1. dataset.py - includes dataset for the RCPSP and 
the corresponding resource capacity 

2. schedule.py - includes the function to apply the 
serial SGS for activity-lists

3. genetic_algorithm.py - includes functions based on 
genetic algorithms

4. main.py - includes functions for procedure
of the genetic algorithm and a function for testscenarios
